# sixaxis-rs
Rust code for parsing /dev/input/js0 when you have a Sony PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS controller.

Based on [code](https://github.com/thejpster/robot) I wrote for my [Pi Wars](http://piwars.org) winning [robot](http://railwayelectronics.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/its-win-for-steve.html) (Intermediate class, 2017).

The values used here were determined by experimentation. Your mileage may vary. Only tested with official Sony DUALSHOCK3/SIXAXIS controllers.

Currently incomplete. Please check back later.
